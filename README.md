# Pinterest Ads Block Configuration Project

This project consists of configuration files for the Pinterest Ads block project `block-pinterest-ads`.
If installed through the marketplace, input the schema and connection values in the install workflow, otherwise edit them in the `manifest.lkml` file.

## To install this block manually, you will need to:

1. Update the constants in the `manifest.lkml` to point to your specific pinterest ads schema and connection name.

1. Enable the Project Import feature currently in /admin/labs on your Looker instance.


Note that the `ref:` should point to the latest commit in each respective repo [block-pinterest-ads](https://github.com/looker/block-pinterest-ads/commits/master)

### Block Info

This Block is modeled on the schema from Fivetrans's [Pinterst Ads ETL](https://fivetran.com/directory/pinterest-ads).

The schema documentation for Pinterest Ads can be found in [API docs](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/?).
